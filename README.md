# Jarvis Nguyen's Portfolio

I created this portfolio using React framework, with the help of Material UI's components and TailwindCSS.

For the carousel that display my projects, sound out for Brainhub and its awesome component. (available at GitHub)

I get my domain from [https://www.hover.com/] and host it free using Firebase [https://firebase.google.com/]
